We will use matrix kinship models in a time-variant framework [@caswell_formal_2021] to compute the expected number of grandparents and grandchildren in a range of countries and the related kin dependencies. 

The code runs in R, preferably in RStudio.

The intuition here is that we can approximate the number of grandparents in a population in year `y` from a number of known quantities: a) the age distribution of grandparents of Focal, b) the age distribution of grandchildren for people alive in year `y`, and c) population size by age in year `y`.

# 1. Installation

Install the [development version](https://github.com/IvanWilli/DemoKin) of DemoKin from GitHub (could take ~1 minute). We made changes to the `DemoKin` package recently. If you had already installed the package, please uninstall it and and install it again.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# remove.packages("DemoKin")

# 2. Get data

Let's get the numbers of China, Guatemala, and Germany:

```{r}

# pick countries
countries <- c("China", "Guatemala", "Germany")
# countries <- c("Guatemala")

output_period <- c(2000, 2020)

# Year range

my_startyr   <- 1950
my_endyr     <- 2022

data <- get_UNWPP_inputs(
  countries = countries
  , my_startyr = my_startyr
  , my_endyr = my_endyr
  )

# Get UN population
# World population in 2022
pop <- 
  # get_unwpp_pop(countries, my_startyr = 2022, my_endyr = 2022) %>% 
    get_unwpp_pop(countries, my_startyr = min(output_period), my_endyr = max(output_period)) %>% 
  filter(sex == "Both sexes") %>%
  select(iso3, year, age, pop_un = value)
```

Run kinship models for 2022 period:

```{r}

period_kin_l <- lapply(split(data, list(data$Location)), function(X){
      print(unique(X$Location))
    U <-
      X %>%
      select(Time, age, px) %>%
      pivot_wider(names_from = Time, values_from = px) %>%
      select(-age) %>% 
      as.matrix()
    f <- X %>%
      select(Time, age, ASFR) %>%
      mutate(ASFR = ASFR/1000) %>% 
      pivot_wider(names_from = Time, values_from = ASFR) %>%
      select(-age) %>% 
      as.matrix()
    k <- kin(U, f, time_invariant = FALSE, output_kin = c("gm","gd"), output_period = output_period)
    k$kin_summary$Location <- 
      k$kin_full$Location <- unique(X$Location)
    k
})

period_kin_full <- 
  lapply(period_kin_l, `[[`, 'kin_full') %>%

# 3. Approximate the number of grandparentes in a population 

Once we have all the data points that we need, we proceed to implement the estimation. Let $A(x)$ be the sum of all individuals who are 'unique' grandparents to people aged $x$:

$$
A(x) = p(x) \times \sum_{i=0}^{100}\left[a(x,i) \times \frac{n(i,x)}{\sum n(i, :)} \right]
$$
<!-- A(x) = p(x) \times \sum_{i=0}^{100}a(x,i) \times \underbrace{\frac{n(i,x)}{\sum n(i, :)}}_{\substack{\text{share of grandkids}\\ \text{aged i}}}   -->


where

  - $p(x)$ is the number of individuals aged $x$ inthe population
  - $a(x,i)$ is the average number of grandparents aged $i$ for a Focal aged $x$
  - $n(i,x)$ is the average number of grandchildren aged $x$ for a Focal aged $i$
  - $n(i,:)$ is the age distribution of grandchildren for a Focal aged $i$
  
The total number of grandparents in the population is $\sum_{x=0}^{100}A(x)$.
  
Let's consider a simplified example: 

  1. Focal is 10yo 
  2. Focal has 0.4 grandmothers aged 85 and 0.1 grandmothers aged 90
  3. 20% of an 85yo Focal is 10yo and 10% of an 90yo Focal is 10yo  
  4. In the 'real' population, there are 1,000 women aged 10
  5. The 'real' number of grandmothers of 10yo Focals in the population is approximately: 1000 * (0.4 * 0.2 + 0.1 * 0.1) = 90 grandmothers


We start by considering the age distribution of grandparents for Focal. Since DemoKin currently assumes a matrilinear female population, we multiply the numbers by 4 to obtain values foe all grandparents (i.e., we use 'GKP factors'):

```{r}
gp <- 
  period_kin_full %>% 
  filter(kin == "gm") %>% 
  select(Location, year, age_focal, age_gp = age_kin, gm = living) %>% 
  # these are just maternal grandmothers. multiply by 4?
  mutate(gp = gm*4) %>% 
  select(-gm)

# Let's see the age distribution of grandparents for a 15 yo Focal

gp %>% 
  filter(Location == "China", year == 2000, age_focal %in% c(0, 15, 30)) %>% 
  mutate(age_focal = as.character(age_focal)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_gp, y = gp, colour = age_focal)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
  
```

Next, we get the distribution of grandchildren for Focals in the same population and year(s). In addition to this, we also compute the share of grandchildren aged x for a Focal aged z (so that it sums to 1 across all age_gd values):

```{r}
gd <- 
  period_kin_full %>% 
  filter(kin == "gd") %>% 
  select(Location, year, age_focal, age_gd = age_kin, gd = living) %>% 
  group_by(Location, year, age_focal) %>% 
  mutate(
    share_gd = gd / sum(gd)
    , share_gd = ifelse(is.nan(share_gd), 0, share_gd)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

# What % of a grandparent's aged 90 are 60yo?

gd %>% 
  filter(Location == "China", year == 2000, age_focal %in% c(60, 75, 90)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(gd:share_gd) %>% 
  mutate(age_focal = as.character(age_focal)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_gd, y = value, colour = age_focal)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~ name) +
  theme_bw()

```

Implement the algorithm by left joining rather than looping for efficiency:

```{r}
gpd <- 
  left_join(
    gp, gd
    , by = c("Location", "year", "age_gp" = "age_focal", "age_focal" = "age_gd")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(iso3 = countrycode(Location, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3c")) %>% 
  select(-Location)

# What % of a 20yo Focal's grandparents are x y old?

gpd %>% 
  filter(iso3 == "CHN", year == 2000, age_focal %in% c(0, 15, 60)) %>% 
  mutate(age_focal = as.character(age_focal)) %>%
  pivot_longer(gp:share_gd) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_gp, y = value, colour = age_focal)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~name) +
  theme_bw()

```



```{r}
# Get total number of grandparentes

gp_num_age <- 
  gpd %>% 
  group_by(iso3, year, age_focal) %>% 
  summarise(gp_sum = sum(gp*share_gd)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # gp_sum is the expected number of 'unique' grandparents for a Focal aged x
  # accounting for the fact some grandparents are shared by multiple grandchildren
  left_join(
    pop %>% select(iso3, year, age, pop_un)
    , by = c("iso3", "year", "age_focal" = "age")
  ) %>%
  mutate(gp_num = pop_un * gp_sum)

# 
# gp_num_age %>% 
#   filter(iso3 == "CHN", year == 2000) %>% 
#   pull(gp_num) %>% 
#   plot()

gp_num <- 
  gp_num_age %>% 
  group_by(iso3, year) %>% 
  summarise(gp_tot = sum(gp_num)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Results

gp_num %>% 
  mutate(gp_tot = gp_tot/1e6 * 4) %>% 
  kable()
  
```


# Compare to simulations

```{r}

sim <- read.csv("Data/grandparents_by_country_age.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

iso3_countries <- countrycode(countries, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3c")

comp <- 
  gp_num_age %>% 
  select(iso3, year, age = age_focal, model = gp_num) %>% 
  left_join(
      sim %>% select(iso3, year, age, sim = number_grandparents)
      , by = c("iso3", "year", "age")
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(model:sim)


comp %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(year~iso3, scale = "free") +
  theme_bw()

```

The two estimates don't match but that would be fine since they are not the same. DemoKin produces the number of unique grandparents by granchild's age, which is why the values for the red line are higher at younger ages. The simulation gives the actual distribution of grandparents over grandparental age. So, the x axis in both plts is different (for the model, x is the age of the child and for the simulation, x is grandparental age). 


Even if we sum it up over all ages, the estimates we get are not very close, with DemoKin giving much lower numbers:

```{r}
comp %>% 
  group_by(iso3, year, name) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_wider() %>% 
  mutate(diff = model-sim) %>% 
  kable()
```
